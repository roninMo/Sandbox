// First in tick the perform move function is called, which executes all the movement logic
// Then it creates a saved move, and uses SetMoveFor to read the safe values and store them in the saved values
// Calls canCombineMoveWith to check if there are any identical moves that can be combined to save bandwidth if necessary
// Then Calls getCompressed flags to reduce the saved move into the small networkable packet that it sends to the server
// Then when the server receives this move it will call updateFromCompressedFlags, and update the state variables with the values sent to it
// Then everything should be replicated and there shouldn't be any weird rubber banding conflicts with the code

// NOTE:
// You can only call moves that alter safe variables on the client
// You can alter movement safe variables in non safe momement functions on the client
// You should never utilize non movement safe variables in a movement safe function so don't call non movement safe functions that alter movement safe variables on the server

*@Documentation Extending Saved Move Data ->  https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/understanding-networked-movement-in-the-character-movement-component-for-unreal-engine

To add new data, first extend FSavedMove_Character to include whatever information your Character Movement Component needs.
Next, extend FCharacterNetworkMoveData and add the custom data you want to send across the network; in most cases, this mirrors the data added to FSavedMove_Character.
You will also need to extend FCharacterNetworkMoveDataContainer so that it can serialize your FCharacterNetworkMoveData for network transmission, and deserialize it upon receipt. When this setup is finised, configure the system as follows:

	- Modify your Character Movement Component to use the FCharacterNetworkMoveDataContainer subclass you created with the SetNetworkMoveDataContainer function.
		The simplest way to accomplish this is to add an instance of your FCharacterNetworkMoveDataContainer to your Character Movement Component child class, and call SetNetworkMoveDataContainer from the constructor.

	- Since your FCharacterNetworkMoveDataContainer needs its own instances of FCharacterNetworkMoveData, point it (typically in the constructor) to instances of your FCharacterNetworkMoveData subclass.
		See the base constructor for more details and an example.

	- In your extended version of FCharacterNetworkMoveData, override the ClientFillNetworkMoveData function to copy or compute data from the saved move.
		Override the Serialize function to read and write your data using an FArchive; this is the bit stream that RPCs require.

	- To extend the server response to clients, which can acknowledges a good move or send correction data, extend FCharacterMoveResponseData, FCharacterMoveResponseDataContainer,
		and override your Character Movement Component's version of the SetMoveResponseDataContainer.

/*
* Character Movement Component In Depth

* Start at the StartNewPhysics function, this is the function that actually moves the character through the world. It checks your movement mode, and then it runs a specific function based on that
	* PhysWalking
	* PhysNavWalking
	* PhysFlying
	* PhysSwimming
	* PhysCustom
	* HandleSwimmingWallHit
	

/// Tick Component ///
* if you move the character by pressing a key, what happens (start at the tick component)
	* It gets the input vectors to calculate the character's movement
	* It checks whether your the autonomous or simulated proxy, if it's the authoritative actor then check if there's prediction data from the server
		* Then, if it's an autonomous proxy, call PerformMovement, and send the saved move to the client.
		* If it's a simulated proxy, call ReplicateMoveToServer (this takes in deltaTime and acceleration)

		// PerformMovement()

		// ReplicateMoveToServer()






// FSavedMove_Character
* Stores a bunch of information about where you were when you started and ended moving, and the physics and acceleration information
* The breakdown of how this is used is this:
	* the Client Data creates a new saved move
	* It records the movement
	* If multiple movements are close to the same then it combines multiple of these movements before sending it to the server
	* It then calls PerformMovement, which is what the server does immediately
	* After that, it calls PostUpdate(), which records the movement information after running the PerformMovement function
	* So every saved move is a record of the information pertaining to the initial location and movement information and the calculated information after you perform a move
	* It saves this information in an array of moves for the server to check against it's own recorded movements, and acknowledges them as valid or sends back a correction to the client 
	* It then runs CallServerMove(), and the server runs it's logic to check whether this is a valid move 
	* There's multiple serverMove functions, and the main one that's called is ServerMove(), and this is where's it's capturing the main movement information to send across the server
	* So in this case, this is where we'd send specific information and extra if necessary for handling specific movement functionality
		* This is where it's grabbing the acceleration, the compressedFlags which is how we're calculating specific input presses like jumping, crouching, sprinting, and so on. 
	
	* ServerMove is a net multicast rpc that runs on both the server and client
		* This unpacks the movement information, runs logic that prevents hacking, and then runs MoveAutoonomous
		* MoveAutonomous replays the move that you saved and sent to the server
		* After MoveAutonomous, the server checks if this is a valid client move by testing it against it's own movement steps
		* It does this through ServerMoveHandleClientError, and this runs ServerCheckClientError. 
			* If the move is invalid, it sets up movement information for correction, and sends that information to the client.
		* Otherwise, it sets the pendingAdjustments timestamp and acknowledges it as a good move,  

		// In the case of an invalid move
		* The invalidMove logic does not set whether it acknowledged it as a bad move in the characterMovementComponent, it actually also locks it down in the UNetDriver.ServerReplicateActors function
		* This is within the NetworkDriver class and sorry this is kinda confusing, but it implements the INetworkPRedictionInterface, and that's what runs the SendClientAdjustment function
		* Then the Character movement component runs SendClientAdjustment
		* This is what runs the ClientAdjustPosition function with the pendingAdjustment information

		* After a good move, it then runs ClientAckGoodMove which acknowledges the good move and this deletes the move from the list
		* After a bad move, ClientAdjustPositon rpc has been called and handled, set it's location and movement information, it sets it's ClientData->bUpdatePosition to true, and in the PostPhysicsTickComponent, and then it handles the correction
			* It then runs back through it's saved moves, and repeats these moves that have not been acknowledged yet from the corrected postion


	* Simulated proxies runs the simulatedTick function to roughly replicate the movement functions


	Adding input replication for the character movement component is trivial and not complicated but you need to be careful about how much information you send across the server
	If everything's already in place, and you're just trying to recouple the client logic for things like sliding and wall jumping that's easy to handle with custom replication flags
	
	If you need to handle anything that's time based, it get's a little tricky because the client and the server don't run on the same tick and you have to account for both the delta time and the function calls to vary between them
		- I thought of a way around this (which is similar to what I was doing with mantling, but I think I just need to catch up with all of the logic anyways)
			- The saved moves captures logic and information within the components, but the movement component is a little possessive and obsessive with what it captures and renders every frame (just let it do it's thing)
			- Regardless, the client and the server are in sync with every calculation that's done with these, even if the server handles these at a later time (and replicates this to other clients while smoothing out the edges)
			- So for things like mantling where you need a smooth interp over an animation (root motion source) (I think) you should actually handle the time based calculations on the client and rep them to the server
			- I just do it with a boolean flag because the simulated proxies also don't register or truly closely couple their logic or config with the server (but this comes back to bite you later (I think it's a good learning lesson tho)

			- But for things like, after you land a wall jump where you need physics tick frames of some other conditional logic, you should pass this information to the savedMoves for replication also
				- The only downside to this is hacking, but (I don't know (potentially (I always think I'm lying or doing something bad)) another way of handling this)
			- Even if they were hacking to exploit things like this, I don't think they'd gain much from doing something like this (other than be incomphrehensibly rude because they don't get the gravity of things or they're just like thirsty or something hoeish)
			- Either way, the client and the server need to be in sync with what moves they calculate to help facilitate building up the character movement, and everything else is just what you want to focus on

	// AirStrafeSpeedGainMultiplier just determines how much velocity is added during strafing
	// AirStrafeRotationRate Calculations (How much speed you're able to attain before drag starts to be added during normal (90-180) strafing rotations)
	// The default values for decent bhop movement is 0.064 gain and 3.4 strafe
	// decreasing the strafe at higher speeds should help with preventing misuse, right now between 2000-3000 you'll get drag if you don't slow down your turns
	// Adding more strafe and less gain at beginning speeds should make it easier
	// Speed and acceleration affect these values. For strafing the acceleration is set to 6400
	

	- Frame combinations for things like slide boosting out of ledge jumps, and other scenarios, and check that this is safe with different frame rates
	- Extra strafing if they press the jump input? Or figure out a good way of handling strafing during different states
