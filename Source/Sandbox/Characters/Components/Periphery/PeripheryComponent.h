 * Just adjust the kinds of periphery you want to use, their detection with, and check that you run the InitPeripheryInformation() (bInitPeripheryDuringBeginPlay) function and you're good
 * 
 * @note There's also a periphery interface for objects having their own logic when they're within the player's periphery
